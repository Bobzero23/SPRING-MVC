RUNNING A WEB APP
1. As we run a normal java class we need a class with a main. It is same to spring boot but the only difference is
   you will have to put this annotation @SpringBootApplication

STATIC FOLDER IN RESOURCES
There is where you put your HTML or CSS and also IMAGES

TO INVOKE THE WEB
1. We need a controller class which will tell the web that we invoking the web from a particular class.
2. Inside that class we use the @Controller annotation
3. Inside the controller class you need to write the method to tell that anyone who opens e.g /home should be redirected
   to e.g home.html and for that we going to use the @RequestMapping("/home") annotation

APPLICATION.PROPERTIES FOLDER
1. Is where you should go if you wanna make any configuration by yourself

CHANGING THE SERVER PORT
1. Go to application.properties folder and write -> server.port = 8081

CHANGING THE CONTEXT PATH
1. Go to application.properties folder and write -> server.servlet.context-path = /demonstration

RANDOM PORT NUMBER
1. Simple go to application.properties folder and write -> server.port = 0
    this will tell the spring that the programmer wants to start the server in a random ports each time
    it is helpful if you wanna run your web app in different instances

LOCAL HOST 8080
1. Using small configuration you can run your localhost without mentioning the /home, check the controller class
    @RequestMapping(value = {"", "/", "home"})

THYMELEAF
1. Moder server side template engine which provides a way for a developer to work frontend and backend, and let
   the developers to deploy their work on the single server
2. By working with Spring MVC, generates the html content based on the template we want

HOW TO USE THYMELEAF
1. Create your html folder inside the template folder because thymeleaf is a template file
2. then you need to import the namespace of the thymeleaf inside of a html file in the html tag
    after you do that your html wills start using thymeleaf tags which start with th
3. After doing that we gonna pass the Model interface and its object on the particular html controller file
    then we will be good to go
4. After passing the Model interface as a parameter in the particular html method then you use the mode.addAttribute
    methods which accepts a variable and a value inside it and both are in quotes "".

DISABLING CACHE IN THYMELEAF
1. This is why you wont have to restart the server everytime you make some change in you template
you just build and then you are good to go
To do it go to the your properties.application and say spring.thymeleaf.cache = false
For more information go check the application properties app there are more details
This is not for java codes so if you change java code you gonna have to restart the server

                                SPRING BOOT DEVTOOLS
This makes you just write java code and just build and you are good to go

                                MVC (MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER)
1. The main objective is to achieve loose double coupling inside the web application we are building.

MVC ARCHITECTURE
1.Client send a request in a http format
2.The request goes to Servlet Container such as Tomcat
3.Then the Servlet Container send the request to the Dispatcher Servlet which found in the web application
4.The request dispatcher tells the.. I WILL CONTINUE WITH THIS SOME DAY
